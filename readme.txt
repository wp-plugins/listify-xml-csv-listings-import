Easily import listings from any XML or CSV file to the Listify theme with the Listify Add-On for WP All Import.

== Description ==

The Listify Add-On for [WP All Import](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-all-import "WordPress XML & CSV Import") makes it easy to bulk import your business directory to the Listify theme in less than 10 minutes.

The left side shows all of the fields that you can import to and the right side displays a listing from your XML/CSV file. Then you can simply drag & drop the data from your XML or CSV into the Listify fields to import it.

The importer is so intuitive it is almost like manually adding a listing in Listify.

We have several other add-ons available, each specific to a different theme. This is a walkthrough of the Realia Add-On, which is very similar to the Listify Add-On.

= Why you should use the Listify Add-On for WP All Import =

* Instead of using the Custom Fields section of WP All Import, you are shown the fields like Listing Expiry Date, Company Name, etc. in plain English.

* Automatically find the listing location just like manually adding a listing.

* Full support for Listify's search dropdowns, categories, settings, and fields.

* Supports files in any format and structure. There are no requirements that the data in your file be organized in a certain way. CSV imports into Listify is easy, no matter the structure of your file.
